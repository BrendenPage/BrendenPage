Hi, Iâ€™m @BrendenPage
- I'm interested in Computer Science and Engineering
- Recently, I've been working on projects for classes, each of which is listed below along with a brief description about the project and my part

UMessage
- I implemented the backend of datastructures (AVL trees, BST, Hash tables, Tries, fixed size circular arrays, using efficient algorithms
  for find, insert, and delete while studying the intricacies of the costs and benifits of each one.
- I have also used these datastructures to implement the backend of "U-message," a program provided for a project in that I use hashing algorithms and huge input
  files to generate likely sentence completions for a working online messaging app that is entirely based off my implementations of datastructures.

Census Parser
- Used both concurrent and sequential programming to iterate through a massive dataset of public census data from 2010 and 2000 to provide an interactive map
  that can be given inputs of map size and locations relative to the total map size of the united states where it will efficiently (O(1)) return the total population
  living within that area.

MyRecipies
- Used Ruby on rails to implement the backend of a webside using a course on Udemy, implemented real time chatroom features as well as secure encryption password
  and login capabilities, account creation.
